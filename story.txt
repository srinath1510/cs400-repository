A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were friends. The Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came and 
they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour.

This was the first time the town mouse had had a meal quite like this one. She was much more used to the cuisine in the town. She looked at her plate then back at 
the country mouse. She was clearly not impressed. The country mouse, saddened that his friend did not like the meal he prepared, left the table and went for a walk
alone.
