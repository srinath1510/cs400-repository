A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were friends. The Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came and 
they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour.

This was the first time the town mouse had had a meal quite like this one. She was much more used to the cuisine in the town. She looked at her plate then back at 
the country mouse. She was clearly not impressed. The country mouse, saddened that his friend did not like the meal he prepared, left the table and went for a walk
alone. 

Being left alone in the house, and not understanding why the country mouse had walked out, the town mouse decided to take a look around. She had never been to her friends house before, so she was very interested to see what it was like. She saw that the house was very rustic, unlike her own. The country mouse did not have as many things as she did either. Not even any food in his kitchen. She now understood why her friend had left; he was offering so much and she had made it seem insignificant. The town mouse ran out of the house, in search of a friend who deserved an apology.
